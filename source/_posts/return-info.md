Return to sender:
•	Returns will leave notes and send astro when a package has been returned if there is no new address in notes.
•	If customer provides new address prior to package being received in returns, just leave normal order note – this is the first place returns checks when package is returned. No need to send astro unless returns has already left a note. If astro is needed, please use Returns Pkg Reship.
•	Tracking information from USPS stating that package arrived in Mebane means it is probably at the post office in Mebane. Mail usually only comes 2-3 times per week.
•	Re-shipped package labels are printed in the returns department unless it is Surepost or International. Returns will put tracking numbers in the order notes.
•	Return to senders are usually held for 30 days.
•	When applicable, contact center will list apartment or suite number on 2nd line of address and advise customers to do the same.

Goodwill:
•	Returns will make sure to double-check the item number when a goodwill note is left to make sure refund is accurate.
•	Contact center will use complaints text or asterisks when leaving notes for returns so that important information is easily found.

Astros:
•	Returns does not have Moxie or telephones, so we cannot contact customer at all.
•	Returns will process refund prior to sending astro.
•	Returns system will automatically refund payment to a GC for orders 6 months old or older.
•	Summary line should always be order number.
•	Looking into creating new categories, such as Custom Exchange, Paypal Exchange, Not in Stock Exchange, Credit Memo/Gift Card Needed, and Returned to Sender so that contact center has an idea of what is needed right from the start.
•	Contact center is working towards all representatives having access to JIRA, but until that time, a group of representatives will assign Astros.
•	Returns should always assign astros to Contact Center Astros, not a specific person.
•	Body of astro should include the order line number and PV number (for customized items) or item number.
•	Body of astro should also state what action is requested, such as:
	Please call customer to place new order (custom items & paypal orders)
	Please email customer to let them know item is not in stock
	Please issue credit/gift card for $
Items for follow-up:
•	Returns scanning exchange forms and attaching them to Astros.
•	Being able to change the address before an item is shipped out if we know it’s wrong (no label yet).
•	Having a character limit in the address line or a pop-up box from FedEx stating “this is what address you’ve entered, but we think …… is correct.” Then, an accept or decline button.
•	Goodwill returns & exchanges so that customer is not refunded & then re-charged.
